h2. What is it ?

It is a functional testing lightweight framework, built around the concept
of business requirements.

As for the name, well jFunc was already taken.


h2. Why are you not using jUnit like all the others?

jUnit is great. But I needed a tool to test several business requirements
on a program which has very heavy fixtures. Couldn't afford to have all
the fixtures re-run before each test.

jFunky allows to do the setup once and for all.

It also does all the requirements checks, regardless of whether one
has failed in the same method. This allows to have a single method
performing all related tests on a requirement without having to break
the flow of execution into small hard-to-follow pieces.


h2. Why are you not using jFunc like all the rest of the others?

My specific need was to be requirement-centric, allowing to group my
tests by business requirement.


h2. Why should I use it?

Being used by anybody else than the author is not a business requirement
for jFunky.
