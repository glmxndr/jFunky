h1. jFuncTest

A functional testing lightweight framework.

h2. Why are you not using jUnit like all the others ?

jUnit is great. But I needed a tool to test several business requirements
on a program which has very heavy fixtures. Couldn't afford to have all
the fixtures re-run before each test.

jFuncTest allows to do the setup once and for all.

It also does all the requirements checks, regardless of whether one
has failed in the same method.
